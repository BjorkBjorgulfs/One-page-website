The idea for this webpage is to help members of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra access informations about the tours that they are going on.
Also so they can access informations that come up while on tour, often it's hard to let the word spread out to 80 people that the plans have
changed.

I wanted to have a clean look, white and grey, with a picture of public transports on the homepage.

The navigation bar is simple with a hover effect (the links don't go anywhere yet)

There is a transparent text box over the image to give it a little bit "extra" since it's a very simple homepage

The footer has all the contact informaion along with a link to the privacy policy (it doesn't go anywhere yet)

Changes I would like to make when I have more time to figure out how to do it:
make sure that the list in the footer does not get stacked when the window is smaller
same thing with the navigation list

I started using github when I finished the coding so there are no commits
